#  Themes

The concept of theme is to define unique, proper and understandable CSS/ SCSS files in the project. Through themes we can give a new look to your styles code and project. You can also sell it to multiple clients by just defining the themes.

##  Why we need Themes?

Themes put important role in the project. Business logic is unique and giving different look to every business according to requirement. Through themes we can do this only.

##  Requirement for Themes?

Themes have basic requirements:
    1. Design Guidelines. Through these guidelines we can get help for different HTML Element designes.Like buttons, tables, cards, accordian, tabs, inputs etc.
    2. Proper knowledge of SCSS/ CSS

##  How we can create Themes?

Themes can be customized from online available themes like Bootstrap, Material etc. and from scratch.

##  What we have done in this Proof of Concept (POC)?

In this we have defined these two themes:
    1. From Scratch: In this we have created a `theme` folder in which we have defined individual files for every element like `variable button, input, table, anchor, accordian` etc. By just importing these files we can simply use that in our components.
    2. Bootstrap Customization: In this I have created a file named `custom-bootstrap.scss`. In this I have overrided the Bootstrap variable with my values. The only drawback is that we can control dark and light theme from single files. We have to create individual file for both light and dark theme if we are using Bootstrap. And according to that we have to load that file.
